Code Used in Completing thesis for Neuroscience MS at WPI

This repository contains code used to optimize and train autoencoders used for denoising low-n reverse correlation reconstructions of MNIST digits. make_best_networks can be run to train the networks using the optimized hyyperparameters. evaluate_best_networks can then be run to load the weights and evaluate the networks on the test images.
